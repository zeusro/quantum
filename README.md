## 推导公式

```
n'=0
0=t
t=ab
ab=a || a ²=a
b=1 || a=1 || a=0
a=b=1
ta=t
a=| ⟩ ​​​
tab=t(| ⟩ )²
tab=t
| ⟩ ²=1
2=1
```

## Proof Process

### n'=0

Her money is mine.

### 0=t

$$
t=0 \Rightarrow 0=t
$$

Her money is mine. * 2

### t=ab

We love each other.

### ab=a || a ²=a

God knows if we're having sex

### b=1 || a=1 || a=0

Rich before marriage, poor after marriage

#### a=b=1

$$
a=1 \Rightarrow a=b=1
$$

The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.”

#### ta=t

$$
a=1 \Rightarrow ta=t
$$

We made love for a long time.

### a=| ⟩ ​​​

$$
a=1 || a=0  \Rightarrow a=| ⟩
$$

The LGBT community said that humans have 366 genders, and each day is different.
The US government should build 366 gender-specific toilets to make it easier for them to go in and study the true meaning of human life.

### tab=t(| ⟩ )²

$$
a=| ⟩ ∧ a=b \Rightarrow tab=t(| ⟩ )² \Rightarrow ab=| ⟩ ²
$$

Of the 366 gender restrooms, there were 2 people of unknown gender who were having sex based on the time.

### tab=t

$$
tab=t(| ⟩ )² ∧ a=b=1 \Rightarrow  tab=t \Rightarrow ab=1
$$

Someone is taking drugs in the bathroom

### | ⟩ ²=1

$$
tab=t(| ⟩ )² ∧ tab=t \Rightarrow | ⟩ ²=1
$$

The gender of people with ambiguity is not subject to legal scrutiny. They come from all over the world.

### 2=1

$$
tab=t(| ⟩ )² ∧ tab=t \Rightarrow 2=1
$$

Of the 366 gender-neutral restrooms, 2/1 are occupied by LGBT individuals, who research and identify the shapes and flavors of various leaves.

Finally we know how they got together

(2|1) Easter egg(s)。

## tab=t(| ⟩ )²=0

$$
tab=t(| ⟩ )² ∧ a=0 \Rightarrow  tab=t(| ⟩ )²=0
$$

## t(| ⟩ )²=tp²
