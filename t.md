## Introduction

The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.
For those of us who believe in physics, the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.

The "primacy dispute" between materialism and idealism is a contradictory proposition and also a non-existent proposition (relegated to secondary nature).

## Mathematical proof

```
1: 2025-10-17 > 1955-04-18 > 1895-08-05 > 1883-03-14 > 1879-03-14 > 1776-08-25
2: t=1
```

t=1 means time is the first dimension.

## Philosophical Explanation

Humans are conscious beings, and the movement of matter requires the observation of time. Therefore, matter, consciousness, and time exist in the same dimension.

However, the importance of time far outweighs that of matter and consciousness, for without time, nothing is meaningful.

The primacy of time means that time, as a dimension, is more important than matter and consciousness.

Both materialism and idealism are personal perceptions and do not align with objective reality.
